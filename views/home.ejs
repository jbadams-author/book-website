          <p>Araja must have done something terrible in his past life to earn himself the curse he bears. While his peers can wield magic with ease, his inability to cast even the simplest spell is his punishment, a consequence of the bad karma from his previous incarnation. Only one fate awaits those who have failed their schooling as miserably as he has.</p>

          <p>The global caste system Araja lives under considers him untouchable, and views him as an animal rather than a man. Denied access to further education, personal property, and even money, his only recourse is to become a bondservant to someone of higher birth.</p>
